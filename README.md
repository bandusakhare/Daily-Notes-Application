# Daily-Notes-Application
To see the project you can visit : https://daily-notes-application.netlify.app/  The project is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here I have used browser localstorage to save the notes entered by the user. So even if user tries to refresh the page notes will not get affected.
